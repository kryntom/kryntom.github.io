        <h2>Achievments</h2>
        <p>There is not much to write about my achievments as there are not many but this will soon be overfilled
          with the various ones that I will be getting in my life. So lets start, my biggest achievment has
          been to get AIR-3034 in JEE-Advanced 2018, AIR-4470 in JEE-Main 2018 and currently studying in a top
          tier Engineering college of the country. I am currently the Campus Ambassador of UC Web, Alibaba group.
          I got 93.6% in CBSE 12th class and 10 CGPA in 10th class. I have won medals in two olympiads and have
          had active participation in various competitions.</p>

      <div class="middle2" id="hobbies">
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Unlike my achievments, I will have to clip down this article because there is a wide variety in it.
          So, first of all, I like technology related stuff. It can be smartphones, PC, consoles, gadgets etc. the
          list is never ending. Then I like to play games of every kind mybe it FPS, racing, fight and many more.
          For every game, I have my own gaming name 'kryntom'. Next, I love to listen to music, watch movies and TV
          series. I play various sports like volleyball, cricket, football etc. I have developed an interest
          in coding which really give me the goosebumps whenever I complete a task or anything else. I am blindly
          in love with two things 'Harry Potter' and 'Marvel'. I can go onto lenghts talking about these
          two things.</p>

      <div class="middle3" id="experience">
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I am going to be having a liitle different layout for this and it is still in progress, so you will have
          to stick by later to see that. I can tell you that I will be writing some memorable experiences over
          here.</p>
